description: "It is I, Samuel! Origin Realms offers loads of custom content, but making brand new items feel as if they belong in the game is no easy task! All of the models and textures you see in game were created by me. I take pride in ensuring everything I do is the best quality down to the very last detail so that you, the player, have the most fun!"
